# SFR-Embedding-Mistral LLamaCPP Example

Small demo of [SFR-Embedding-Mistral](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/SFR-Embedding-Mistral) currently the N1 embedding model in the [HF leader board](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) working on an environment composed of langchain and llamacpp, using the huggingface pipeline because sentence-transformers gives too much problems and it is quite inefficient RAM-wise which can make the program all more unstable for system of 32gb of ram and under.
